**GENERAL CODE OF CONDUCT (CoC)** 

All members of OBS are expected to adhere to the following CoC in galaxy chat (GC), alliance chat (AC), private messages (PM, DM) and discord servers:

1) Leave the Drama at the door.

2) Every member of OBS shall comport themselves in a manner that is uncompromisingly civil, at all times.

3) OBS members shall not make derogatory, incendiary, or demeaning comments to anyone on the basis of race, sex, gender identity, familial status, political affiliation, sexuality, handicap, religion, or national origin whether privately or publicly. 

4) Be respectful of all players. Remember a human being is on the other side of your message. Treat people how you would want to be treated. If the person on the other side of your message is new then take the opportunity to teach. They could very well become a great addition to OBS one day.

5) Help each other in anyway possible. We are a team, which means going out of our way to lend a hand and making sacrifices for each other. 

Infractions will result in disciplinary measures such as reprimands, reductions in rank, temporary bans, and permanent expulsion depending on severity and member history. 

The Council shall have sole and absolute discretion in this alliance to determine if members meet or may have violated these standards and to implement disciplinary measures. 

By remaining in OBS players agree to follow and be held accountable to this Code of Conduct.
