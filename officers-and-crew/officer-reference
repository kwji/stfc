~~Assuming the ability triggers, then *all kinetic weapons* will fire in round 2 regardless of their firing pattern, and their firing patterns will then proceed based on their recharge times counting from round 2.
For example, consider the Saladin's kinetic weapon with a 3 round recharge:
- Nominally, firing occurs in rounds 1, 4, 7, 10, ...
- With Kuron, firing firing occurs in rounds: 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, ...~~

The `20%` bonus to officer abilities only applies to combat abilities. 
Non-combat abilities, such as bonus cargo capacity, are displayed as though the `20%` bonus is applied but this is a display error.
The `20%` bonus is not applied the same way to all combat abilities. The bonus is additive for some officer abilities and multiplicative for others. For example: `Harrison`'s base `60%` shield ignore is increased to `80%`, however `Decius`'s base `7%` damage bonus is increased to `8.4%`.
