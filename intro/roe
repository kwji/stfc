**General ROE**

**Stations** 

*Neutral* stations are fair and legal hits unless an exception is noted.

*Friendly* stations can only be hit after being issued a 2 minute warning.

*Allied* stations are off-limits.

**Warships** 

*Neutral* warships (Explorers, Interceptors, Battleships) are fair and legal hits unless an exception is noted.

**Survey Vessels** 

*Neutral* survey vessels can only be hit in the following cases:

- *Over Protected Cargo (OPC, OC)*

- *Zero Node (Z-Node) outside Territories* - OBS will only hit Z-Nodes that are *outside* of territories and only if planning to take the node within 10 minutes. You must send a message to the target telling them they are "zero node" and retain screenshots proving Z-Node status to be produced in the event of a dispute.

- *Surveys used as warships* - Survey vessels being used to drain a station or engage hostiles are legal hits.

- *Non-D'Vor mining double latinum nodes* - Any non-D'Vor ship that is mining a double latinum node can be attacked only if you subsequently mine the node yourself. You are responsible for defending it.

*Allied* and *Friendly* survey vessels can only be hit in the following cases:

- *Over Protected Cargo (OPC, OC)* -  You must issue the target a 2 minute warning before attacking and retain a screenshot of your warning to be produced in the event of a dispute.

Exceptions:

- Transwarp-gated mining systems are no-hit zones.

**Territory Capture Takeovers**

OBS has agreed to operate independently in TC, neither helping nor receiving help from any other alliances.

*Uncontested* Takeovers (only a single alliance has formally joined the takeover) are open for PvP.

Exceptions:

- *UPC miners* - During uncontested takeovers UPC survey vessels actively engaged in mining are off-limits.

**War**

While at war with an alliance (marked as enemy) all ships and stations are considered legal targets at at all times. (Kill on sight, KoS)
