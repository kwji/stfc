**Command Structure**
Council Member - Fbunnyfufu - Diplomat
Council Member - WildeChilde - Diplomat
Council Member - Diri - Bureaucrat

All Council Members are equal in rank and will make all major decisions as a team.

**Code of Conduct**
OBS members are expected to adhere to our #code-of-conduct and treat all other players with respect at all times. This applies to Global Chat (GC), Alliance Chat (AC), Direct/Personal Messages (DMs, PMs), and Discord.

**Discord**
Joining our discord and reading daily is required. Discord is the easiest method to disseminate information as the game chat leaves a lot to be desired.

**Event Participation**
All PvE alliance events are mandatory. The reason for this is if everybody contributes you not only get rewards yourself but you help everybody get rewards. See #event-guidelines.

**Extended Away**
If you will be away for an extended period of time please list the dates in our #vacations channel.

**Armadas**
The game automatically assigns priority based on ship power but armada leaders will try their best to make sure everyone gets into some each week. Please understand that Cores and Directives for upgrading the Armada Control Center (ACC) and lead armadas are expensive/slow to obtain. Be good teammates and make sacrifices for each other so that everyone can participate and benefit from armadas. See #armada-guidelines.

**ROE**
Please review our general and KANG-specific ROEs in #roe and #kang-obs-roe. 
If you are hit in violation of ROE please open a ticket. Visit #tickets and click the :envelope_with_arrow: emote on the initial post. This will open a private channel for you to describe the issue and post a screenshot for leadership to resolve. **Do not retaliate on your own**. Hitting back on your own makes diplomacy and declaring war useless.  However attacking their warship or base is fine unless its an ally or friendly.
