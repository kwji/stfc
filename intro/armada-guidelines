@everyone
Welcome to the new members.

Armadas are a tough conversation and what I don't want is for it to become an issue.

We have seen some negative comments in Alliance chat where people are grumbling about not getting into an Armada.

So let me set the guidelines for the alliance and try to be fair to everyone.

When you are hosting an armada please post Size (2 M, 12 M, etc..), Type of Armada (Premade or Pick UP group), UNC/Rare/Epic, how many members you can host.

A premade group is a team that has coordinated who is going to be a member (use a voice channel if you want).

A PUG (Pickup Group) is simply letting the software choose who is being selected (by power).

Some suggestions that might help everyone:
- If the armada is in Exchange area and you are sending a non stella - you may get prioritized lower for Stellas.   Especially if its someone running the larger ones (rares/epics) then the stellas will bring more to the armada.

- If it's a larger armada (8M, 12M, etc..) and you are sending a 150k ship, there is a major possibility that you will not make the armada.

- Armadas are expensive (if the person is buying the armada packs).  The epic armadas are literally $33 per and the rares are $16.60 each.  So if the host sees that he/she doesn't have enough power to down the armada they will probably reach out to bigger ships to ensure they are not loosing their "investment".

- There are two ways to ensure that you are getting into the Armada - Host it or put together a premade group.  Sending your bigger ship will increase your chances.

If a council members see people complaining openly because they didn't get "chosen" for an armada and wasted their time, mats, etc.. they will reach out to the member and ask for it to stop.  We don't want the people spending their time and or their money to host these to stop because of the negative attitude.

If you have any questions, please ask!

Everyone leave an emote reaction letting me know that you read this.
