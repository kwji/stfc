@everyone
Welcome to our new members!

Alliance Events are a core part of OBS's identity so we want to discuss what we expect from our team here at OBS when it comes to those events.

OBS was founded on 3 principles:
1)  No DRAMA
2)  We are a hard charging *team*
3)    We dominate both PvP *and* Events

When alliance events are running we expect full participation from our entire team.

For most alliance events there are corresponding solo events running simultaneously that help you earn points towards the alliance event. We expect you to complete your solo events and help OBS earn the best alliance rewards possible. We do not want people who are only here to collect free alliance rewards.  

We do have a spreadsheet where we are tracking activity and highlighting both non-participation and poor participation during events.  If we see multiple highlights by your name, then a leader will reach out to you to understand if there is something going on and offer help.  Please respond and work with them as we want everyone to grow and be successfull here. We want to help anyone who is trying to improve and contribute to the team. We also understand that the max of an Ops 38 and the max for an Ops 25 are drastically different and do not expect the same scores.

The only events that we do not track are Domination type events that force you to level-up or spend cash.  Frequently these are also run back-to-back and we know that most people will have exhausted their speedups and resources in previous runs. 

To help members maintain situational awareness we will ask an officer or council member to post which events we are pushing for and we will be instituting the following in-game rank structure:
- *Commodore* - Council members and special recruiters
- *Premier* - Officers and exemplar members 
- *Operative* - Proven members
- *Agent* - Unproven members (new or needs improvement)
