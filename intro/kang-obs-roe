OPC is OPC - A two minute warning PM must be sent to allied ship commander before attacking. This holds true everywhere in the galaxy (with the exclusion of Borg Lat and special Rogue systems).  Members of both KANG and OBS are encouraged to hunt for OPCs in each other’s territories.

Zero Node - If you need the node then treat as OPC. 

Shield or Share - If you come across an allied base that is unshielded and appears inactive send a PM notifying the owner of their status.  If no response is received within 2 minutes reach out to their leadership to give them a chance to contact the person. If they cannot be reached then the leadership will give their blessing for you to rally and raid the base. The leadership should then also rally their alliance to defend. This will allow both sides to train on raiding and defending. The raiding alliance is responsible for taking the affected commander on a raiding run to replace the loss of RSS. Mass coordinated base sneak attacks (Operation Kitten Cuddle) are forbidden against allies.  However, coordinating a Cross Alliance Kitten Cuddle would be good training. 

Mutual Defense - Upon discovering the base of an ally being raided share the coordinates on AC with a call to rely to defend. Then PM mørtaH, Thete, or the commodore's active and they will “@ everyone” in the emergency comms channel of the other alliance with the coordinates of the base being raided. 

Territories - Full defense partners on all territory events. You are expected to show up to all territory events for both alliances.  When an uncontested territory event goes into Overdrive the guest alliance will train attacking and the defending/takeover alliance will train defending.
