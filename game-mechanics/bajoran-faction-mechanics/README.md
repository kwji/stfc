__Dominion Solo Armadas__
- **Dominion Solo Armadas** require sending 3 of your own ships to attack a Dominion armada.
- Use **Dominion Solo Armada Directives** to run **Dominion Solo Armadas** in **Dominion Space**
    - Armada targets immediately repair all hull damage after an unsuccessful attempt
- Defeat Uncommon/Rare/Epic **Dominion Solo Armadas** to earn Uncommon/Rare/Epic **Dominion Solo Armada Credits** and **Dominion Solo Armada Edicts**
    - Higher level and higher rarity armadas reward more **Dominion Solo Armada Edicts**
- Spend **Dominion Solo Armada Credits** and **Dominion Solo Armada Edicts** in the **Bajoran Faction Store** to pull armada chests giving unique rewards:
    - **Bajoran Credits**
    - Uncommon/Rare/Epic **Dominion Solo Armada Directives**
    - DS9 Officer Shards - `Changeling Kira`, `Miles O'Brian`, `Benjamin Sisko`
    - **Diplomacy Tokens** - Purchase other materials in the **Bajoran Faction Store**
- **Dominion Solo Armadas** are typically short duration and do not deal significant critical damage so player ship crews should focus on maximizing damage mitigation and critical hit chance. Examples:
    - `5 of 11`, `6 of 11`, `Khan`
    - `Sisko`, `O'Brian`, `Bashir` 
    - `Picard`, `Beverly`, `Lorca`
- To maximize armada rewards use the **Defiant** and greedy crews, however the risk of failure with greedy crews is increased. Examples:
    - `5 of 11`, `6 of 11`, any officer
    - `Geordi`, synergy officer, `5 of 11`
