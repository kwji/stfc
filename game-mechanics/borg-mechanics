- Borg Systems: probe, latinum, lucrative, armada, mega-cube
- `Borg Refinery`: upgrade `Vidar`/Borg Officers, access latinum/lucrative Borg Systems, gain Faction Credits/Rep
- Borg Armadas: terrible

**Game Loop**
- Collect 2x free `Transwarp Cell`'s from *Gifts* tab daily
- Visit `Transwarp Cell`-gated Borg probe systems in your `Vidar` to farm `Inert Nanoprobes` by killing `Borg Tacticle Probe` hostiles and `Latinum Antique`'s by killing `Assimilated Ferengi Trader` hostiles (very rare spawns)
- Refine `Inert Nanoprobes` into `Active Nanoprobes` or `Charged Nanoprobes` in the `Borg Refinery`
- Use `Active Nanonprobes` to promote Borg Officers
- Use `Charged Nanoprobes` to upgrade your `Vidar` or purchase Faction Credit and Faction Reputation bundles in the `Borg Refinery`
- Refine `Latinum Antique`'s in the `Borg Refinery` to receive: Resource Tokens, Ship XP, `Transwarp Cell`'s, `Lucrative Transwarp Cell`'s, `Uncommon Latinum Transwarp Cell`'s, `Rare Latinum Transwarp Cell`'s, `Epic Latinum Transwarp Cell`'s
