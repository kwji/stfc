WIP: How are ships selected, power requirements, reward distribution, display bug, what armadas are good for you

**Basic Mechanics**
- The `Armada Control Center` (ACC) building must be constructed before you can run armadas. A higher level ACC allows you run armadas with larger fleets and provides a greater damage bonus against armadas.
- Directives
- Automatic ship selection, Stars, Display bug
- Rewards distribution
- Alliance Store

** Successful Armadas**
- `~40%` Power threshold
- Considerations for leaders
- Considerations for participants
~~Stop hogging armada slots and share you dickheads....~~

**Overview**
Armada strength and difficulty depend on the Armada's level and quality (Uncommon, Rare, Epic):

Victory depends on several factors:
- Crew loadouts
- Raw fleet strength
- `Armada Control Center` (ACC) level

Ships are selected to participate based on power by default:
- Only a single ship per player may participate in a single armada
- More powerful ships are selected over less powerful ships
- There is a display error where the Armada dialogue box displays incorrectly low ship power values. This does not impact any mechanics, it is purely a display error.  
- Armada leaders can override the default ship selection by staring the ships they wish to participate

Rewards are distributed to participants according to their power contribution:
- Participants receive a percentage of the rewards based on the percentage of the total fleet power their ship contributed. 
- Ex: Someone with a 1M power ship in a 5M power fleet will receive 1/5 of the rewards, while someone with a 2M power ship in a 5M power fleet will receive 2/5 of the rewards.
