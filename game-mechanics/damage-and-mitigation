**Overview**  
Damage in STFC can be broken down as follows:
1. `Damage Dealt` - Attacker's raw damage output 
2. `Damage Mitigated` - Portion of the attacker's `Damage Dealt` eliminated by the defender's `Damage Mitigation`.
3. `Damage Received` - The un-mitigated portion of the attacker's `Damage Dealt`.
    - `Shield Damage Received` - Portion of `Damage Received` applied to the defender's `Shield Health`.
    - `Hull Damage Received` - Portion of `Damaged Received` applied to the defender's `Hull Health`.

**Damage Dealt**  
`Damage Dealt = Base Damage` * `Damage Multipliers`
- `Base Damage` - Listed weapon damage with no officers assigned.  Defined by the range `[Min Weapon Damage, Max Weapon Damage]`
- `Damage Multipliers` - Building bonuses, Research bonuses, Officer attack bonus

**Damage Mitigated**  
See the mitigation calculator to test things out: https://stfc-toolbox.now.sh/mitigation

The defender's `Damage Mitigated` is computed as a simple percentage of the attacker's `Damage Dealt` based on the defender's `Damage Mitigation`.
- `Damage Mitigated = Damage Dealt * Damage Mitigation`

The defender's `Damage Mitigation` value is the percent of an attacker's `Damage Dealt` that is mitigated by the defender (ex: `50%`). 
- `Damage Mitigation` is a function of the defender's mitigation stats (`Shield Deflection`, `Armor`, `Evasion`) and the attacker's piercing stats (`Shield Piercing`, `Armor Piercing`, `Accuracy`) and is subject to diminishing returns, capping out at `~72%`.
- Each ship class has a primary mitigation stat that is weighted more heavily than the others when computing damage mitigation:
- Explorers: `Shield Deflection`
- Battleships: `Armor`
- Interceptors: `Evasion`
- For example: All things being equal, a single point of additional `Shield Deflection` will result in a larger `Damage Mitigation` value for an explorer than for an interceptor or battleship.

**Damage Received**  
`Damage Received = Damage Dealt - Damage Mitigated`

`Shield Damage Received = Damage Received * Shield Mitigation`
- `Shield Mitigation` - The percent of `Damage Received` that is applied to the defender's `Shield Health`, `80%` by default.

`Hull Damage Received = Damage Received - Shield Damage Received`
- Once the defender's `Shield Health` is depleted, all `Damage Received` is applied to the defender's `Hull Health`.

Note: `Shield Mitigation` is a critical concept. Officers like `Harrison`, `TOS Uhura`, and `Harry Mudd` function by altering the default `Shield Mitigation` value of `80%` in some way. 
- Rank 1 `Harrison` - Scales down the opponent's `Shield Mitigation` by `60%` for round 1 resulting in a `Shield Mitigation` value of `80% * 0.4 = 32%`. This means that `68%` of the opponent's`Damage Received` is applied their `Hull Health` directly instead of the standard `20%` for Round 1.
