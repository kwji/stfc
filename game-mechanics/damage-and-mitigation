WIP: damage, mitigation, shield vs hull distribution, diminishing returns

**Overview**
Damage in STFC can be broken down as follows:
1. Damage Dealt 
2. Damage Mitigated 
3. Damage Received
3a. Shield Damage Reveived
3b. Hull Damage Received

**Damage Dealt**
-  `Damage Dealt`: Base Damage * Damage Modifiers
- Base Damage: [Min Weapon Damage, Max Weapon Damage] No officers assigned
- Damage Modifiers: buildings, research, officer attack bonus

**Damage Mitigated**
See the mitigation calculator for details and to test things out: https://stfc-toolbox.now.sh/mitigation
*Damage Mitigated:* *Damage Dealt* * *Mitigation*
*Mitigation* is a function of the defending ship's mitigation stats (`Shield Deflection`, `Armor`, `Evasion`) and the attacking ship's piercing stats (`Shield Piercing`, `Armor Piercing`, `Accuracy`) and is subject to diminishing returns, capping out at `~72%`.
Each ship class has a primary mitigation stat that is weighted more heavily than the others when computing damage mitigation:
- Explorers: `Shield Deflection`
- Battleships: `Armor`
- Interceptors: `Evasion`
For example: All things being equal, a single point of additional `Shield Deflection` will result in a larger *Damage Mitigation* value for an explorer than for an interceptor or battleship.

**Damage Received**
Damage Received: Damage Dealt - Damage Mitigated
Shield Damage Received: `80%` of Damage Received
Hull Damage Received: `20%` of Damage Received 
If there is insufficient shield health remaining, the excess damage is applied to the hull health instead.
Officers like `Harrison`, `TOS Uhura`, and `Harry Mudd` function by altering the `80%`/`20%` damage received distribution.
