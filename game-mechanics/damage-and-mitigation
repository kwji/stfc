**Overview**

Damage in STFC can be broken down as follows:
1. `Damage Dealt` - Attacker's raw damage output 
2. `Damage Mitigated` - Portion of the attacker's `Damage Dealt` eliminated by the defender's `Damage Mitigation`.
3. `Damage Received` - The un-mitigated portion of the attacker's `Damage Dealt`.
    - `Shield Damage Received` - Portion of `Damage Received` applied to the defender's `Shield HP (SHP)`.
    - `Hull Damage Received` - Portion of `Damaged Received` applied to the defender's `Hull HP (HHP)`.

**Damage Dealt**

`Damage Dealt = Base Damage` * `Damage Multipliers`
- `Base Damage`: Listed weapon damage with no officers assigned. [Min Weapon Damage, Max Weapon Damage]
- `Damage Multipliers`: buildings, research, officer attack bonus

**Damage Mitigated**

See the mitigation calculator for details and to test things out: https://stfc-toolbox.now.sh/mitigation


The defender's `Damage Mitigated` is computed as a simple percentage of the attacker's `Damage Dealt` based on the defender's `Damage Mitigation`.
- `Damage Mitigated = Damage Dealt * Damage Mitigation`

The defender's `Damage Mitigation` value is the percent of an attacker's `Damage Dealt` that is mitigated by the defender (ex: `0.5` or `50%`). 
- The defender's `Damage Mitigation` is a function of the defender's mitigation stats (`Shield Deflection`, `Armor`, `Evasion`) and the attacker's piercing stats (`Shield Piercing`, `Armor Piercing`, `Accuracy`) and is subject to diminishing returns, capping out at `~72%`.
- Each ship class has a primary mitigation stat that is weighted more heavily than the others when computing damage mitigation:
- Explorers: `Shield Deflection`
- Battleships: `Armor`
- Interceptors: `Evasion`
- For example: All things being equal, a single point of additional `Shield Deflection` will result in a larger *Damage Mitigation* value for an explorer than for an interceptor or battleship.

**Damage Received**

Damage Received: Damage Dealt - Damage Mitigated
Shield Damage Received: `80%` of Damage Received
Hull Damage Received: `20%` of Damage Received 
If there is insufficient shield health remaining, the excess damage is applied to the hull health instead.
Officers like `Harrison`, `TOS Uhura`, and `Harry Mudd` function by altering the `80%`/`20%` damage received distribution.
